Hack-Circuit is a web game where the main objective is to fight enemies on different levels. When you defeat the enemies, you have to hack a castle, and you do this by solving a puzzle. But be careful... Some of them are cheaters.

The game has online features. I created a section called the Game Blog, a place where players can leave reviews, share ideas, and more. It also includes a real-time chat so players, regardless of their level, can talk while playing. This entire real-time system was built with FIREBASE.

## ‚ú® Features

The game was created with inspiration from a modern UI to adapt to computers, utilizing intermediate design technologies to achieve this. Its architecture is made up of real-time sections, making it a standout game.

---

I used technologies such as ReactJS, NextJS, HeroUI, TailwindCSS so that the entire project has two important pillars in web programming, the backend and the frontend, the design was created with TailwindCSS and HeroUI, and for real-time functionality I used FIREBASE and its ecosystem.

This game was created as a participation in Hack Club, a strong thanks for being the world leader of hackers.
